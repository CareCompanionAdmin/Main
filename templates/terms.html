                <p>If informal resolution is unsuccessful, any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules.

The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.</p>

                <h3>10.4 Exceptions</h3>
                <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement of intellectual property rights.</p>

                <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

                <h3>14.3 Waiver</h3>
